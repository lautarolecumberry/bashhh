# Write a Simple Operating System (OS) Kernel

- What you'll learn: Memory management, interrupts, bootstrapping, and hardware interaction.
- Why it's beneficial: Writing an OS kernel from scratch is one of the best ways to understand low-level system programming. You'll get to interact with hardware, manage memory, and understand how the operating system interfaces with the machine.
- What to do:
    1. Start by writing a "Hello World" kernel that can boot up on your computer.
    2. Progress to handling simple I/O (like printing text to the screen).
    3. Work on implementing basic OS concepts such as memory allocation (heap, stack), process scheduling, and maybe even a basic file system.
